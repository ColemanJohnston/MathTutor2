//Description: A program to give a user math questions 
//             and tell the user if they got the right answer or not.
#include<iostream>
#include<cstdlib>
#include<ctime>
using namespace std;

// ********************************************************
char menu();
//Summary: will have the (+ , - , * , / , Q) so you can pick which problem you want to do.
//Precondition: user picks char (‘a’ for + , ‘s’ for  - , ‘m’ for * , ‘d’ for / , ‘q’ for Q) for the problem they want
//Postcondition: it will return the character from the user

// ********************************************************
int addition();
//Summary: adds two random ints between the range of 1 to 12.
//Precondition: It will have you do the problem 5 times and makes sure you are doing it right
//Postcondition: it will return the number of times the user answered correctly.

// ********************************************************
int multiplication();
//Summary: Multiplies two random ints between the range of 1 to 12.
//Precondition: It will ask the user 5 multiplication problems.
//Postcondition: It will return the number of times the user answered correctly.

// ********************************************************
int subtraction();
//Summary: subtracts two random integers between 1-12
//Precondition: It will ask the user 5 subtraction questions 
//Postcondition: it will return the number of times the user answered correctly

// ********************************************************
int division();
//Summary: Divides two random ints between the range of 1 to 12.
//Precondition: It will ask the user 5 division problems. 
//Postcondition: It will return the number of times the user answered correctly.

// ********************************************************
 void compliment();
 //Summary: gives the user a random compliment.
//Precondition: the user got a correct answer.
//Postcondition: A random compliment is printed to the screen.

// ********************************************************
void encourage();
// Summary: gives the user a random encouragement.
// Precondition: the user got an incorrect answer.
// Postcondition: a random encouragement is printed to the screen. 

// ********************************************************
int check( int answer, int correct );
//Summary: checks for the right and wrong answers
//Precondition: it will check if the user’s answer is correct
//Postcondition: it will return 1 for a right for a correct answer and call compliment() and it will //return 0 for a wrong answer and call encourage.
